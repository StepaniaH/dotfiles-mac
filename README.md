# dotfiles-mac [ARCHIVED]

## Archive Notice

**Note: This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained.**

I previously managed my configuration files using two separate repositories:
- `dotfiles-arch`: for Arch Linux configurations ([here](https://github.com/StepaniaH/dotfiles-arch))
- `dotfiles-mac`: for macOS configurations (this repository)

To simplify management and improve consistency across my environments, I have merged these repositories into a new unified dotfiles repository:

**[dotfiles](https://github.com/StepaniaH/dotfiles)**

## Migration

If you were using configurations from this repository, please migrate to the new unified repository. The new repository features a more organized structure with platform-specific directories and conditional configurations to handle differences between operating systems.

## Why Merge Repositories?

The main reasons for merging the repositories:

1. **Reduce code duplication** - Many configurations are largely identical across platforms
2. **Simplify maintenance** - Only one repository to manage
3. **Unified experience** - Consistent working environment across different systems
4. **Better organization** - Platform differences handled through conditional configurations

Thank you for your interest in this repository!
